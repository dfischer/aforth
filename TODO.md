# TODO
- Redo branches to use jump to memory instead of jump to offset
- Macro to make `lit, xxx, branchz` more readable in asm code
- Restructure dictionary to allow long word names
- Use standard word names
- Align better with FORTH standard
- Rewrite some forth words in aforth.S to assembly where the forth implementation is more complex
- Figure out how a prompt can be provided in the outer interpreter
- Implement more control flow words
- Facilitate hiding of words, and hide some internal words
- Let primitive and forthword macros have better defaults for flags so usage does not need to specify in most cases
- Use system call to request more memory instead of defining max memory at build time
